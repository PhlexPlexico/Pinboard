 #Requirements to Run
 - if you are viewing on the live site, you need a facebook or a google+ account to login. As for now, Google+ is most reliable as there have been changes to Facebook API and it may not work.
 - if you are running the site locally, it will not work because both the
   google+ login and facebook login API's are tied to a specific domain name, 
   in our case the live site, so feel free to look at the code locally and 
   view the site on the live version.
